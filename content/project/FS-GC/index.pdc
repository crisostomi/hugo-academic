# Abstract

Many modern deep-learning techniques do not work without enormous
datasets. At the same time, several fields demand methods working in
scarcity of data. This problem is even more complex when the samples
have varying structures, as in the case of graphs. Graph
representation learning techniques have recently proven successful in
a variety of domains. Nevertheless, the employed architectures perform
miserably when faced with data scarcity. On the other hand, few-shot
learning allows employing modern deep learning models in scarce data
regimes without waiving their effectiveness. In this work, we tackle
the problem of few-shot graph classification, showing that equipping a
simple distance metric learning baseline with a state-of-the-art graph
embedder allows to obtain competitive results on the task. While the
simplicity of the architecture is enough to outperform more complex
ones, it also allows straightforward additions. To this end, we show
that additional improvements may be obtained by encouraging a
task-conditioned embedding space. Finally, we propose a MixUp-based
online data augmentation technique acting in the latent space and show
its effectiveness on the task.

# Introduction

Graphs have ruled digital representations since the dawn of Computer
Science. Their structure is simple and general, and their structural
properties are well studied. Given the success of deep learning in
different domains that enjoy a regular structure, such as those found in
computer vision (Baumgartner et al. 2017; J. Zhang et al. 2019; Smirnov
and Solomon 2021) and natural language processing (Brown et al. 2020;
Mikolov et al. 2013; Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2019), a recent
line of research has sought to extend it to manifolds and
graph-structured data (Bronstein et al. 2017; Hamilton, Ying, and
Leskovec 2017; Battaglia et al. 2018). Nevertheless, deep learning
expressivity comes at a cost: deep models require vast amounts of data
to search the complex hypothesis spaces they define. When data is
scarce, these models end up overfitting the training set, hindering
their generalization capability on unseen samples. While annotations are
usually abundant in computer vision and natural language processing,
they are harder to obtain for graph-structured data due to the
impossibility or expensiveness of the annotation process
(Hu et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020). This is
particularly true when the samples come from specialized domains such as
biology, chemistry and medicine (Hassani 2022), where graph-structured
data are ubiquitous. For instance, drug testing requires expensive
in-vivo and laborious wet experiments to label drugs and protein graphs
(Ma et al. 2020).

To address this problem, the field of Few-Shot (FS) learning (Fei-Fei,
Fergus, and Perona 2006; Fink 2004) aims at designing models which can
effectively operate in scarce data scenarios. While there has been some
interest in FS node classification and link prediction, graph-level
classification has mostly been overlooked in the FS setting. A general,
high-level strategy for learning with little data consists of extracting
knowledge from a related domain where the available data is enough to
learn a reliable hypothesis and then adapt it to the task of interest.
The latter is usually called the target task, while the data abundant
one is denoted as source. When the task of interest is classification,
categories from the source task are said to be *base* classes, while
those of the target are called . Distance metric learning techniques
have proven to be particularly effective for the problem, as samples
embedded in a lower-dimensional space need fewer data to be
discriminated. Among these methods, Prototypical Networks (Snell,
Swersky, and Zemel 2017) has been one of the most successful, obtaining
remarkable results in various tasks without waiving its simplicity.
Surprisingly, versions of it have been derubricated to baseline in other
existing FS graph classification works without much relevance. We
confute in this work these misconceptions, showing that we can obtain
competitive results in the task by equipping Prototypical Networks with
a state-of-the-art graph embedder.

As typical in FS learning, we frame tasks as episodes, where an episode
is defined by a set of classes and several supervised samples (supports)
for each of them (Vinyals et al. 2016a). Such an episode is depicted in
. While a standard Prototypical Network would embed the samples in the
same way independently of the episode, we take inspiration from
(Oreshkin, López, and Lacoste 2018) and empower the graph embeddings by
conditioning them on the particular set of classes seen in the episode.
This way, the intermediate features and the final embeddings may be
modulated according to what is best for the current episode.

Given the insufficiency of the data to allow learning meaningful
features for the target task from scratch, a learning model will often
represent samples from the novel classes as a rearrangement of features
from the data-abundant base classes. To this end, we propose a novel
online data augmentation technique that creates artificial samples from
two existing ones as a mixup of their latent representations. Training
on these mixups of samples from the base classes forces the model to
expect combinations of the base samples already at training time.

In summary, our contribution is three-fold:

1.  Showing that a distance metric learning approach, while simple,
    works better than more complex meta-learning approaches for the task
    of FS graph classification;

2.  Equipping the architecture with an episode-adaptive module,
    enhancing its expressivity to obtain more dynamic representations;

3.  Suggesting a novel online data augmentation technique that creates
    new artificial samples in the latent space, showing a significant
    performance gain.

All our results are general and apply equivalently to any kind of graph
family considered. All our code is available for research purposes.

#### Graph Representation Learning

Given graphs expressive power, graph-based modeling is ubiquitous in a
variety of domains, ranging from social networks (Fan et al. 2022; Monti
et al. 2019) to chemistry (Duvenaud et al. 2015; Fout et al. 2017;
Stokes et al. 2020). In the graph representation learning context, the
focus is on finding the best possible representation for these data
structures: it usually involves the learning of a mapping between the
discrete graph space and a continuous latent one in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that
should encode both topological features and signal possibly defined over
nodes or edges. These features are usually obtained by graph
convolutions (Kipf and Welling 2017; Velickovic et al. 2018). Due to its
theoretical expressive power, we employ a Graph Isomorphism Network (Xu
et al. 2019) as graph embedder. While the essence of supervised DL
approaches requires large volumes of annotated data to learn from (Lake
et al. 2017), the intrinsic structural complexity of graphs and their
application in very specialized fields often give rise to annotation
problems. When this happens, the too few supervised samples are not
enough to fit the deep models, consequently hindering their
performances.

#### Few-Shot Learning

FS learning has gained attention as a means to tighten the gap between
machine learning models and human-like learning capability. In fact, the
capacity to generalize from few examples is an hallmark of human
intelligence already from infancy, as children can, for example, learn
words they have heard only once (Carey and Bartlett 1978). In practice,
several high-level paradigms are used in literature to solve tasks in a
FS scenario: *transfer learning* techniques (Liu et al.
2018; Luo et al. 2017) aim at transferring the knowledge gained from a
data-abundant task to a task with scarce data; ii) *meta-learning*
(Finn, Abbeel, and Levine 2017; Yoon et al. 2018; Ravi and Larochelle
2017) techniques more generally introduce a meta-learning procedure to
gradually learn meta-knowledge that generalizes across several tasks;
iii) *data augmentation* works (Wu et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2018; Tsai
and Salakhutdinov 2017) seek to augment the data applying
transformations on the available samples to generate new ones preserving
specific properties. We refer the reader to (Yaqing Wang et al. 2020)
for an extensive treatment of the matter. Particularly relevant to our
work are distance metric learning approaches: in this direction,
(Vinyals et al. 2016a) suggest embedding both supports and queries and
then labeling the query with the label of its nearest neighbor in the
embedding space. By obtaining a class distribution for the query using a
softmax over the distances from the supports, they then learn the
embedding space by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. (Snell,
Swersky, and Zemel 2017) generalize this intuition by allowing $k$
supports for class to be aggregated to form prototypes. Given its
effectiveness and simplicity, we chose this approach as the starting
point for our architecture.

#### Graph Data Augmentation

Data augmentation follows the idea that in the working domain, there
exist transformations that can be applied to samples to generate new
ones in a controlled way (*e.g.*, preserving the sample class in a
classification setting while changing its content). Therefore, synthetic
samples can meet the needs of large neural networks that require
training with high volumes of data (Yaqing Wang et al. 2020). In
Euclidean domains (*e.g.*, images), this can often be achieved by simple
rotations and translations (Benaim and Wolf 2018; Santoro et al. 2016).
Unfortunately, in the graph domain, it is challenging to define such
transformations on a given graph sample while keeping control of its
properties. To this end, (Park, Shim, and Yang 2022; Yiwei Wang et al.
2020; H. Guo and Mao 2021; Han et al. 2022) propose to augment graph
data directly in the data space, while (Yiwei Wang et al. 2021)
interpolates latent representations to create novel ones. We also
operate in the latent space, but differently from (Yiwei Wang et al.
2021), we suggest creating a new sample by selecting only certain
features of one representation and the remaining ones from the other by
employing a random gating vector. This allows to obtain artificial
samples that are randomly composed of the features of the existing
samples, rather than a linear interpolation of their features.

#### Few-Shot Graph Representation Learning

FS graph representation learning is concerned in applying graph
representation learning techniques in scarce data scenarios. Similarly
to standard graph representation learning, it tackles tasks at different
levels of granularity: node-level (Zhou et al. 2019; S. Zhang et al.
2019; Yao et al. 2019; N. Wang et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020),
edge-level (Baek, Lee, and Hwang 2020; Sheng et al. 2020; S. Wang et al.
2021; Lv et al. 2019) and graph-level (Z. Guo et al. 2021; Yaqing Wang
et al. 2021; Chauhan, Nathani, and Kaul 2020; Ma et al. 2020; Jiang et
al. 2021). In this work, we tackle the problem of FS graph
classification. The first work to study graph classification in a FS
setting can be traced to (Chauhan, Nathani, and Kaul 2020) (GSM). Its
contributions resulted in a helpful baseline method and datasets for the
following works in the literature. Following works adapted MAML (Finn,
Abbeel, and Levine 2017) to the graph setting (Ma et al. 2020) and
proposed a modified version of Prototypical Networks leveraging domain
specific priors (Jiang et al. 2021). Differently from the latter, we do
not make any such assumption and do not change the original loss
function, obtaining superior performance.

# Approach

#### Setting and Notation

In FS graph classification each sample is a tuple
$(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}), y)$ where
$\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ is a graph with node set
$\mathcal{V}$ and edge set $\mathcal{E}$, while $y$ is a graph-level
class. Given a set of data-abundant *base* classes $C_{\text{b}}$, we
aim to classify a set of data-scarce *novel* classes $C_{\text{n}}$. We
cast this problem through an episodic framework (Vinyals et al. 2016b):
during training, we mimic the FS setting dividing the base training data
in episodes. Each episode e is a $N$-way $K$-shot classification task,
with its own train ($D_{\text{train}}$) and test ($D_{\text{test}}$)
data. For each of the $N$ classes, $D_{\text{train}}$ contains $K$
corresponding *support* graphs, while $D_{\text{test}}$ contains $Q$
*query* graphs. A schematic visualization of an episode is depicted in .

![Prototypical Networks architecture. A graph encoder embeds the
supports graphs, the embeddings that belong to the same class are
averaged to obtain the class prototype $p$. To classify a query graph
$q$, it is embedded in the same space of the supports. The distances in
the latent space between the query and the prototypes determine the
similarities and thus the probability distribution of the query among
the different classes, computed as in
.](figures/architecture.jpg){#fig:prototypical-architecture}

#### Prototypical Network (PN) Architecture

We build our network upon the simple-yet-effective idea of Prototypical
Networks (Snell, Swersky, and Zemel 2017), originally proposed for FS
image classification. We employ a state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network
(GNN) as node embedder, composed of a set of layers of GIN convolutions
(Xu et al. 2019), each equipped with a MLP regularized with GraphNorm
(Cai et al. 2021). In practice, each sample is first passed through a
set of convolutions, obtaining a hidden representation ${h}^{(l)}$ for
each layer. According to (Xu et al. 2019), the latter is obtained by
updating at each layer its hidden representation as $$\begin{aligned}
 \label{GIN-agg}
        \mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} =   {\rm MLP}^{(l)}   \left(  \left( 1 + \epsilon^{(l)} \right) \cdot \mathbf{h}_v^{(l-1)} +  \sum\nolimits_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \mathbf{h}_u^{(l-1)}\right).\end{aligned}$$
where $\epsilon^{(l)}$ is a learnable parameter. Following (Xu et al.
2018), the final node $d$-dimensional embedding $\mathbf{h}_v \in R^{d}$
is then given by the concatenation of the outputs of all the layers
$$\mathbf{h}_v = \text{CONCAT}\left( \left\{ \mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} \right\}_{l=1}^{L} \right)$$
where $L$ is the total number of layers in the network. The graph-level
embedding is then obtained by employing a global pooling function, such
as mean or sum. While the sum is a more expressive pooling function for
GNNs (Xu et al. 2019), we observed the mean to behave better for the
task in most considered datasets and will therefore be the aggregation
function of choice when not specified differently. The $K$ embedded
supports $\mathbf{s}_1^{(n)}, \dots, \mathbf{s}_K^{(n)}$ for each class
$n$ are then aggregated to form the class prototypes $\mathbf{p}^{(n)}$,
$$\mathbf{p}^{(n)} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{s}_k^{(n)}$$ In
the same way, the $Q$ query graphs for each class $n$ are embedded to
obtain $\mathbf{q}_1^{(n)}, \dots, \mathbf{q}_Q^{(n)}$. To compare each
query graph embedding $\mathbf{q}$ with the class prototypes
$\mathbf{p}_1, \dots, \mathbf{p}_N$, we use an $\mathcal{L}_2$-metric
scaled by a learnable temperature factor $\alpha$ as suggested in
(Oreshkin, López, and Lacoste 2018). We refer to this metric as
$d_{\alpha}$. The class probability distribution $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ for
the query is finally computed by taking the softmax over these distances
$$\boldsymbol{\rho}_n = \frac{\exp \left( -d_{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}_n) \right)}{\sum_{n'=1}^{N} \exp(-d_{\alpha}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}_{n'}))}.
    \label{eq:proto-class-distr}$$ The model is then trained end-to-end
by minimizing via SGD the log-probability
$\mathcal{L}(\phi) = -\log \boldsymbol{\rho}_n$ of the true class
$n$. We will refer to this approach without additions as PN in the
experiments.

#### Task-Adaptive Embedding (TAE)

Until now, our module computes the embeddings regardless of the specific
composition of the episode. Our intuition is that the context in which a
graph appears should influence its representation. In practice, inspired
by (Oreshkin, López, and Lacoste 2018), we condition the embeddings on
the particular task (episode) for which they are computed. Such
influence will be expressed by a translation $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and a
scaling $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$.

First of all, given an episode $e$ we compute an episode representation
$\mathbf{p}_{\mathbf{e}}$ as the mean of the prototypes $\mathbf{p}_n$
for the classes $n = 1, \dots, N$ in the episode. We consider
$\mathbf{p}_{\mathbf{e}}$ as a prototype for the episode and a proxy for
the task. Then, we feed it to a *Task Embedding Network* (TEN), composed
of two distinct residual MLPs. These output a shift vector
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_\ell$ and a scale vector $\boldsymbol{\gamma}_\ell$
respectively for each of the layers of the graph embedding module. At
layer $\ell$, the output $\mathbf{h}_{\ell}$ is then conditioned on the
episode by transforming it as
$$h_{\ell}' = \boldsymbol{\gamma} \odot h_{\ell}+\boldsymbol{\beta}.$$
As in (Oreshkin, López, and Lacoste 2018), at each layer
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ are multiplied by two
$L_{2}$-penalized scalars $\gamma_{0}$ and $\beta_{0}$ so to to promote
significant conditioning only if useful. Wrapping up, defining
$g_{\Theta}$ and $h_{\Phi}$ to be the predictors for the shift and scale
vectors respectively, the actual vectors to be multiplied to the hidden
representation are respectively
$\boldsymbol{\beta}= \beta_0 g_{\Theta}(\mathbf{e})$ and
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}= \gamma_0 h_{\Phi}(\mathbf{e}) + \mathbf{1}$. When
we use this improvement in our experiments, we add the label TAE to the
method name.

#### MixUp (MU) Embedding Augmentation

Typical learning pipelines rely on data augmentation to overcome limited
variability in the dataset. While this is mainly performed to obtain
invariance to specific transformations, we use it to improve our
embedding representation, promoting generalization on unseen feature
combinations. In practice, given an episode $\mathbf{e}$, we randomly
sample for each pair of classes $n_1, n_2$ two graphs
$\mathcal{G}^{(1)}$ and $\mathcal{G}^{(2)}$ from the corresponding
support sets. Then, we compute their embeddings $\mathbf{s}^{(1)}$ and
$\mathbf{s}^{(2)}$, as well as their class probability distributions
$\boldsymbol{\rho}^{(1)}$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^{(2)}$ according to .
Next, we randomly obtain a boolean mask
$\boldsymbol{\sigma} \in \{0,1\}^k$. We can then obtain a novel
synthetic example by mixing the features of the two graphs in the latent
space
$$\tilde{\boldsymbol{s}} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{s}_{1} + (\mathbf{1} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \mathbf{s}_{2},$$
where $\mathbf{1}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector of ones. Finally, we
craft a synthetic class probability $\tilde{\rho}$ for this example by
linear interpolation
$$\tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}} =\lambda \boldsymbol{\rho}^{(1)} + (1 - \lambda) \boldsymbol{\rho}^{(2)} \label{eq:linear-interpolation-distr}$$
where
$\lambda = \left( \frac{1}{d} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{d} \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \right)$
represents the percentage of features sampled from the first sample. If
we then compute the class distribution $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ for
$\mathbf{s}$ according to , we can ask it to be similar to by adding the
following regularizing term to the training loss
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{MU}} = \| \boldsymbol{\rho} - \tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}}\|_2^2.$$
Intuitively, by adopting this online data augmentation procedure, the
network is faced with new feature combinations during training, helping
to explore unseen regions of the embedding space. The overall procedure
is summarized in .

![Mixup procedure. Each graph is embedded into a latent representation.
We generate a random boolean mask $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and its
complementary $\mathbf{1} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}$, which describe the
features to select from $\mathbf{s}_1$ and $\mathbf{s}_2$. The selected
features are then recomposed to generated the novel latent vector
$\tilde{\mathbf{s}}$. ](figures/mixup.jpg){#fig:mixup

# Experiments

## Datasets {#sec:datasets}

We benchmark our approach over two type of datasets: the first one was
introduced in (Chauhan, Nathani, and Kaul 2020), and consists of:

1.  `TRIANGLES`, a collection of graphs labeled $i=1, \dots, 10$, where
    $i$ is the number of triangles in the graph.

2.  `ENZYMES`, a dataset of protein tertiary structures from the BRENDA
    database (Chang et al. 2020); each label corresponds to a different
    top-level enzyme.

3.  `Letter-High`, a collection of graph-represented letter drawings
    from the English alphabet; each drawing is labeled with the
    corresponding letter.

4.  `Reddit-12K`, a social network dataset where graphs represent
    threads, with edges connecting users interacting. The label of a
    thread is given by the corresponding discussion forum.

We will refer to this set of datasets as $\mathcal{D}_\text{A}$. The
second set of datasets was introduced in (Ma et al. 2020), and consists
of:

1.  `Graph-R52`, a textual dataset in which each graph represents a
    different text, with words being connected by an edge if they appear
    together in a sliding window.

2.  `COIL-DEL`, a collection of graph-represented images obtained
    through corner detection and Delaunay triangulation.

We will refer to this set of datasets as $\mathcal{D}_\text{B}$. The
overall dataset statistics are reported in .

It is important to note that only the datasets in $\mathcal{D}_\text{B}$
have enough classes to permit a disjoint set of classes for validation.
In contrast, a disjoint subset of the training samples is used as a
validation set in the first four by existing works. We argue that this
setting is critically unfit for FS learning, as the validation set does
not make up for a good proxy for the actual testing environment since
the classes are not novel. Moreover, the lack of a reliable validation
set prevents the usage of early stopping, as there is no way to decide
on a good stopping criterion for samples from unseen classes. We
nevertheless report the reports on this evaluation setting for the sake
of comparison.

## Baselines

We extensively compare our results to the other existing works in
current literature, *i.e.* the pioneering work GSM (Chauhan, Nathani,
and Kaul 2020), the current state-of-the-art method (AS-MAML) (Ma et al.
2020) and the most recent SMF-GIN (Jiang et al. 2021). As in (Ma et al.
2020), we decided to directly report the results included by the
respective authors in their works.

##### GSM

As a first step, the authors compute graph prototypes and then cluster
them based on their spectral properties to create super-classes. These
are then used to generate a super-graph which is employed to separate
the novel graphs. As previously stated, the class prototypes are
computed from the spectral properties of the graphs rather than the
average of their embeddings, as usually done in prototypical networks.

##### AS-MAML

This solution follows the meta-learning framework, and it is based on
the popular Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) architecture (Finn,
Abbeel, and Levine 2017). The authors moreover propose a reinforcement
learning-based adaptive step controller to improve the robustness of the
graph meta-learner.

##### SMF-GIN

A GNN is employed to encode both global (attention over different GNN
layer encodings) and local (attention over different substructure
encodings) properties. We point out that they include a ProtoNet-based
baseline. However, their implementation does not accurately follow the
original one, and, differently from us, leverages domain specific prior
knowledge.

## Experimental details

Our graph embedder is composed of two layers of GIN followed by a mean
pooling layer and the dimension of the resulting embeddings is set to
$64$. Furthermore, both the latent mixup regularizer and the L2
regularizer of the task-adaptive embedding are weighted at $0.1$. The
framework is trained with a batch size of $32$ using Adam optimizer with
a learning rate of $0.0001$. We implement our framework with Pytorch
Lightning (Falcon et al. 2019) using Pytorch Geometric (Fey and Lenssen
2019) and Wandb (Biewald 2020) to log the experiment results of the
model. The specific configurations of all our approaches are reported in
.

# Results

#### Benchmark $\mathcal{D}_\text{A}$

As can be seen in , the proposed approach compares favorably in the
large majority of the considered datasets. We obtain an overall margin
of $+7.24\%$ and $+4.9\%$ accuracy compared to GSM (Chauhan, Nathani,
and Kaul 2020) for $k=5, 10$ respectively, while the improvements are
$+0.96\%$ and $+0.86\%$ with respect to AS-MAML (Ma et al. 2020). We
note that the latter are only computed over `TRIANGLES` and
`Letter-High`, as the authors chose not to evaluate over the two
remaining datasets in the $\mathcal{D}_A$ benchmark. However, we again
stress the partial inadequacy of these datasets as a realistic
evaluation tool due to the lack of a disjoint set of classes for the
validation set.

#### Benchmark $\mathcal{D}_\text{B}$

Consistently, our approach yields significant improvements over both
`COIL-DEL` and `R-52`. In fact, shows that the model obtains an average
margin of $+4.37\%$ and $+4.53\%$ over AS-MAML (Ma et al. 2020) for
$k=5, 10$ respectively. Interestingly, a vanilla Prototypical Network
(PN) architecture with the proposed graph embedder is already sufficient
to obtain state-of-the-art results. The subsequent rows then show the
efficacy of the proposed improvements. Task-adaptive embedding (TAE)
allows obtaining the most critical gain, yielding an average increment
of $+2.82\%$ and $+2.42\%$ for the $5$-shot and $10$-shot cases,
respectively. Then, the proposed online data augmentation technique (MU)
allows obtaining an additional boost, especially on `COIL-DEL`. In fact,
in the latter case, its addition yields a $+0.65\%$ and $+1.72\%$
improvement in accuracy for $k=5, 10$. We notice that on this benchmark
we obtain a large margin of improvement w.r.t. the state of the art.
These are also the datasets in which the evaluation has the more
grounded setting, given the availability of a proper validation set.

#### Qualitative analysis

The latent space learned by the graph embedder is the core element of
our approach since it determines the prototypes and the subsequent
sample classification. To provide a better insight into our method
peculiarities, depicts a T-SNE representation of the learned embeddings
for novel classes. Each row represents different episodes, while the
different columns show the different embeddings obtained with our
approach and its further refinements. We also highlight the queries
(crosses), the supports (circles) and the prototypes (star). As can be
seen, our approach separates samples belonging to novel classes into
clearly defined clusters. Already in PN model, some classes naturally
cluster in different regions of the embedding. The TAE regularization
improves the class separation without changing the disposition of the
cluster in the space significantly. Our insight, is that the context may
let the network reorganize the already seen space, without moving far
from the already obtained representation. Finally, MU allows better use
of previously unexplored regions, as expected from this kind of data
augmentation. We show that our feature recombination helps the network
better generalize and anticipate the coming of novel classes.

![Visualization of novel episodes latent spaces from the `COIL-DEL`
dataset, through T-SNE dimensionality reduction. Each row is a different
episode, the colors represent novel classes, the crosses are the
queries, the circles are the supports and the stars are the prototypes.
The left column is produced with the base model PN, the middle one with
the PN+TAE model, the right one with the full model PN+TAE+MU. This
comparison shows the TAE and MU regularizations improve the class
separation in the latent space, in particular our novel data
augmentation MU is essential to obtain accurate latent
clusters.](figures/results.jpg){width="\\textwidth"}

# Conclusions

#### Limitations.

Employing a graph neural network embedder, the proposed approach may
inherit known issues such as the presence of information bottlenecks
(Topping et al. 2021) and over smoothing. These may
be aggravated by the additional aggregation required to compute the
prototypes. The readout function to obtain a graph-level representation
is already an aggregation of the node embeddings. Also, the
nearest-neighbour association in the final embedding assumes that it
enjoys a euclidean metric. While this is an excellent local
approximation, we expect it may lead to imprecision. To overcome this,
further improvements can be inspired by the Computer Vision community.

#### Future works.

In future work, we aim to enrich the latent space defined by the
architecture, for instance, forcing the class prototypes in each episode
to be sampled from a learnable distribution rather than directly
computed as the mean of the supports. Moreover, it may be worth
introducing an attention layer to have supports (or prototypes,
directly) affect each other directly and not implicitly, as it now
happens with the task embedding module. We also believe data
augmentation is a crucial technique for the future of this task: the
capacity to meaningfully inflate the small available datasets may result
in a significant performance improvement. In this regard, we plan to
extensively test the existing graph data augmentation techniques in the
few-shot scenario and build upon MixUp to exploit different mixing
strategies, such as non-linear interpolation.

#### Conclusions.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of FS graph classification, an
under-explored problem in the broader machine learning community. The
problem is particularly relevant in specialized domains such as biology
and chemistry, given the nature of the samples to annotate. We propose a
distance metric learning approach to tackle the problem, as samples
embedded in a lower-dimensional space need fewer data to be
discriminated. In this regard, we suggest adapting Prototypical Networks
to the graph modality, showing that its simplicity does not undermine
its effectiveness in the task. We then suggest valuable additions to the
architecture, adapting a task-adaptive embedding procedure and designing
a novel online graph data augmentation technique. Lastly, we prove their
benefits for the problem over several datasets. We hope this work
encourages researchers and practitioners to reconsider the effectiveness
of distance metric learning when dealing with graph-structured data. In
fact, we believe metric learning to be incredibly fit for dealing with
graphs, considering that the latent spaces encoded by graph neural
networks are known to capture both topological features and node signals
efficaciously.
