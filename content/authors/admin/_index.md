I am an enthusiastic Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, where I am part of the [GLADIA research group](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it), led by prof. Emanuele Rodol√†.

I believe curiosity to have a primary role in guiding research, and hence I am always looking forward to explore new  directions in my field. 
My background includes hands-on research experience in **Natural Language Understanding**, **Computer Vision** and **Geometric Deep Learning**. 
Some of my more stable interests include frontier Machine Learning themes such as **Graph Representation Learning**, **Few-Shot Learning** and **Multi-modality**.

I wholeheartedly advocate for cleaner code in ML, as complexity should not be fought with more complexity.
Maybe unsurprisingly at this point, I really enjoy coding. Funnily enough, I enjoy it so much that I often code as a mean to get away from a tiring day of coding. 

In my (too little) free time, I enjoy throwing away my laptop to reconnect with nature through hiking and/or camping. 
Finally, like most of the humans on this planet, I enjoy travelling and good food.
