I am an enthusiastic *computer science* researcher driven by an unmatched amount of curiosity.

My interests span across various topics of the field, with a focus on modern *Artificial Intelligence*. My background includes hands-on research experience in **Natural Language Understanding**, **Computer Vision** and **Geometric Deep Learning**.
I am particularly excited by frontier Machine Learning themes such as **Graph Representation Learning**, **Few-Shot Learning** and **Causality**.
